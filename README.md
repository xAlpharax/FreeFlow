**FreeFlow** is a comprehensive **e-learning platform** designed to enhance the learning experience for university students. Built on a powerful combination of Node.js and React, FreeFlow adopts the **xAPI** and **LTI paradigms**, providing a seamless and intuitive interface for both students and educators. This platform aims to offer a **rich learning environment**, making it easier for students to access relevant resources and for educators to **deliver content in a structured manner.**

## Features

**xAPI Integration:** FreeFlow utilizes the xAPI (Experience API) to track and analyze student interactions with learning resources, enabling a personalized and adaptive learning experience.

**LTI Support:** Leveraging the Learning Tools Interoperability standard, FreeFlow seamlessly integrates with various educational tools, creating a unified learning ecosystem.

**Node.js Backend:** The backend is powered by Node.js, ensuring scalability, efficiency, and a robust server infrastructure.

**React Frontend:** The frontend is built with React, providing a responsive and dynamic user interface for an optimal user experience within a single page application soon to be PWA.

**Resource Recommendation:** FreeFlow employs intelligent algorithms to recommend learning resources based on user behavior, preferences, and academic progress with the help of Artificial Intelligence.
